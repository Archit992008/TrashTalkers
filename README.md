Trash Talker 🌍♻️
Trash Talker is a simple-to-use, appealing website designed to minimize trash and broken community equipment, keeping our streets safe and clean. The website is incredibly user-friendly, as volunteers can help out in three ways.

## 🚀 Features
Report an issue. If someone spots something that needs attention, they can capture a photo of the issue and select a category for it, followed by an optional description (e.g., “Broken glass near the playground”).

Join our crew of dedicated volunteers and make a direct impact on our community. They can use the Google Form linked on the website to sign up for community clean-up initiatives and choose the tasks, timings, and roles that work best for them. Their preferences, ranging from working with tools to selecting their own team roles, are taken into account as well. 

Donate money to support our mission. The money will be used to buy gloves, bags, tools, and refreshments for volunteers so we can organize more cleanup drives across the city. Payments are processed securely, using simple information.
