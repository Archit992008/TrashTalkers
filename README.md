# TrashTalkers
Trash Talker is a simple, user-friendly site that keeps communities clean. Users can report issues by uploading photos and selecting a category, join volunteer clean-up crews through a Google Form, or donate to support supplies like gloves, bags, and tools. Together, we make our streets safer and cleaner.
